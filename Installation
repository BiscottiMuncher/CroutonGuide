Now that your in develope mode you can install Crouton and then Linux

1.Getting crouton installed

    ~ These files are all for the insallation of Crouton
  - While these files are downloading go and get the executable for Crouton

    1a. Making the file executable
      - This file alone cannot do anything so we have to make it an executable.
        ~ Hop into a new terminal window and type "shell", this will allow you to exxecute developer commands.
          - "sudo install -Dt /usr/local/bin -m 755 ~/Downloads/crouton"
          - This will make the file an executable
          
2.Running the Executable
